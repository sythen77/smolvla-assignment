note: I’m sorry for submitting the task after the deadline — this was my first time working with GitHub and completing this type of assignment. It took me a long time to learn many things, such as how to use Hugging Face, how to upload datasets, and how to properly work with GitHub itself.
I also needed time to understand the task, and unfortunately I wasn’t able to complete all the required steps. I believe I made several mistakes, and my solution reflects my current understanding of the task from my own point of view.
I would be very grateful if you could leave me some feedback, even if my answers are not perfect. Any notes or explanations would really help me improve and understand where I went wrong.

another note: I wrote the code in Google Colab and then downloaded it.
trial1 contains the final and complete solution.
trial2 was only for trying things out and getting started.
You can just check trial1.
